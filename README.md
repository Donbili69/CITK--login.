.🚀 Next-Gen Web Interface SuiteA collection of high-fidelity, interactive web components featuring advanced CSS3 animations, glassmorphism, and neural-inspired UI/UX. This repository showcases the intersection of Aesthetic Design and Functional Utility.🛠 Project Catalog1. CITK Research Portal (Institutional Gateway)A cinematic entry point designed for the Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar.Core Tech: CSS 3D Transforms, JavaScript Typewriter Engine, Radial Gradient Layering.Key Features:Sequential Loading: Typewriter effect for Mission/Vision statements.Secure Access Simulation: A 3D-rotating login card with backdrop-filter blur.Responsive Branding: Integrated institutional identity with a "Cyber-Industrial" theme.2. Neural Translate Pro (Sticker Edition)A sophisticated language translation utility powered by the MyMemory API.Core Tech: Web Speech API, Async/Await Fetch, Flexbox/Grid.Key Features:Real-time Translation: Debounced input handling for instant results.Voice Engine: Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT).Sticker UI: Floating animated "status" badges using CSS keyframe animations.Multi-Language Support: Preset mappings for Hindi, Japanese, Spanish, and French.🎨 Design PhilosophyBoth projects utilize a "Dark Mode First" approach with the following design tokens:Blur & Glass: Extensive use of backdrop-filter: blur(25px) for depth.Neon Accents: Primary palettes using Cyber Pink (#ff7eb3) and Neon Cyan (#00f2fe).Typography: A blend of Orbitron (for technical headers) and Montserrat/Poppins (for readability).🚀 Installation & UsageClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
